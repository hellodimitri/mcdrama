# McDrama
This repository contains necessary elements for a UPP 465 course assignment.
McDrama is the silly name I chose for the repository, reflecting my most recent experience with McDonald's that let to a true, classic overdeveloped world breakdown of emotions when an ice cream machine breaks.
But also, this is a complete joke.

The data presented in the map was collected using Survey123 and self-entering randomized McDonald's locations in central Chicago. The survey collected spatial information in standard U.S. addreesses. It also included qualitative information like a 1 to 5 star rating query and an open ended response as to how the user justified that rating.

Survey data was projected onto a map using ArcGIS Online. Data points were classified on a red to green scale by their 1 to 5 ranking. Pop-ups were configured to display the McDonald's location's name, its rating, and the reasoning behind it. 

The basemap is a default ArcGIS Online option called "Streets" and was made available through Esri.
