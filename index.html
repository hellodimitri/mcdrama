	<p class="bodytext">A few days ago, McDonald's messed up my order. <br><br> Normally, as a reasonable Millennial who understands how difficult food service can be, I'd let this one slide. But after a difficult day of being overworked, with little to no time for myself, ALL I wanted was a comforting side of fries, some chicken nuggets, and one of those fudge sundaes that's so pedestrian, it's actually genius. <br><br>
		Can you guess my dilemma? <br><br>
		The ice cream machine was broken. <br><br>
		And in the spirit of post-capitalism, this map rates all of central Chicago's McDonald's locations for my very subjective, but very accurate truths.</p></div></div>

		This map identifies McDonald's locations in central Chicago according to ratings I gave them. Ratings are on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being a terrible experience and 5 being a fantastic experience. The map includes pop-ups that describe my reasonings for giving such ratings. <br><br>
		Overall, this information is 100% factual and indisputable. Thank you.
